# Tetris
 This is a replication of the famous game Tetris and is created in C++. This
game uses the Tetris Guidelines for naming of variables and awarding points to 
the player. These guidelines can be found 
 [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g55gwls0h2muqzn/tetris%20guideline%20docs%202009.zip?dl=0)
or a summary can be found [here](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline).

## Motivation
I decieded to replicate Tetris as a way to expand my coding knowledge as well as
to build a simple video game. I am interested in making video games and this is
a nice way to get my feet in the water.

## Installation
To install, run, and play this Tetris, download Tetris.zip. Unzip the file and run Tetris.exe. 

## Features
While following a simple [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH_omFPqMO4)
I was able to implement the main functionality of Tetris. While the tutorial was
helpful it stopped short of being a true game. 

In order to complete this replica,
I have added a point system. Using the guidelines mentione above the point system 
for clearing 1 to 4 lines was added. 

In addition the game would only end if the
player clicked the close button on the window. Thus a game over feature and a
quit button were added to make the game feel more real.

## Style Guide
This code follows the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

on Youtube for giving me the idea and a great start. The background, play area
frame, as well as the tile textures were provided by them. The score frame can be
